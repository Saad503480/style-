  <h1 id="head1">SOLAR SYSTEM</h1>
  <p1 class="para1" style="font-size: 30px;" >A solar panel is a device that converts sunlight into electricity by using photovoltaic (PV) cells. PV cells are made of materials that produce excited electrons when exposed to light. The electrons flow through a circuit and produce direct current (DC) electricity, which can be used to power various devices or be stored in batteries. Solar panels are also known as solar cell panels, solar electric panels, or PV modules.</p1>
  <h2 id="head2">BENEFITS</h2>
  <P2 class="para1" style="font-size:  30px;">Solar power is a clean, low-cost renewable energy source that can be generated anywhere the sun shines. The purpose of solar installation is to connect several devices to build a solar power system generating energy from the sun. The sunâ€™s light energy is then converted into electricity, which is used for domestic and industrial activities.Solar power has a relatively simple operating principle. First, the solar panel system is installed on the roof (roof top solar), wall, or other suitable places to get maximum sun exposure. Sunlight shining directly on the solar cell will be converted into direct current by the photovoltaic effect.</P2>
